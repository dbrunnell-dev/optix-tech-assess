# Tech assessment notes

Time spent 4 hours 

# Next steps: - 

Testing - functional unit tests on api calls / hooks / helpers and snapshot tests on components 

Reusable - Seperate the movie aspect from the code and create generic atomic components that can pass props in to alter text for movies 

Styling - Make the application responsive so it can be viewable on smaller devices 

Error handling - Custom error handling for api calls
